  status: past
  role: During my almost 4,5 years at H & M I worked with all aspects of the test role - from test designing upon the requirements specifications, time estimating and planning tests, to "hands on" carrying out system-, integration-, regression-, as well as acceptance tests. My work was carried out in close collaboration with the user representatives, requirement specialists and developers. Most of the systems were closely linked to each other, so good knowledge about integration and ability to work with all team members as well as other groups was crucial. Beyond the test work I quite often acted as requirement analyst clearing up requirements from the clients as well as supporting them  worldwide in their system related questions. I worked a lot with usability issues and improvment suggestions about how to make the systems more user-friendly in order to facilitate for the users.
