# Zuzanna's Portfolio
## at CraftAcademy bootcamp week 3

**Assignment**

The challenge is to build a static website using HTML, CSS and Middleman as a framework. An individual portfolio that presents all the past projects and all the projects that I am currently working on.

**Setup  Middleman and create your project**

1. In your terminal create a new Portfolio directory and `cd` into that directory
2. Run `gem install middleman` (make sure you have Ruby installed on your computer)
3. Run `middleman init my_site`(this will create a new folder my_site and generate starter files for the project)
4. Add `gem 'middleman-liverload'` in the Gemfile and run `bundle install`
5. Add `activate :liverload` at the top of the line in the configuration file config.rb
6. `cd my_site` and run `middleman server`(this will install your local server)
7. Access the site at http://localhost:4567/

**Middleman directory structure**

* my_site/
* +-- .gitignore
* +-- Gemfile
* +-- Gemfile.lock
* +-- config.rb
* +-- source
*     +-- images
*         +-- background.png
*         +-- middleman.png
*     +-- index.html.rb
*     +-- javascripts
*         +-- all.js
*     +-- layouts
*         +-- layout.erb
*     +-- stylesheets
*         +-- all.css
*         +-- normalize.css
